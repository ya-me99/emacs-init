Emacs Lisp Basics

Lisp is core concept is Evrything is a list

a list looks like this (ab cd) it contains
ab and cd called atoms basicly variables
they may be data or functions
seperated by whitespace

if a list is quoted '(abcd dd) it is evaluated not to execute
commands

if it is unqouted (abcd dd) the first atom is considerd a
command the following are considerd arguments

Set Variable With setq , set  oder let
setq sets a atom to some value the quote has the same meaning
as usuall

(setq flower 1)
(describe-variable 'flower)
returns flowers value = 1

      (describe-variable test))
